## Working With Text Data In Machine Learning

## Abstract:
Textual data is unstructured by nature and therefore cannot be used in its raw form for automated analysis and information retrieval. Consequently, before applying machine learning methods, it is necessary to perform some kind of preprocessing. Another problem with modeling text is that most of machine learning algorithms require fixed-length inputs and outputs. There are different techniques for obtaining fixed-length representations of textual data depending on how and which linguistic properties do we want to represent. A couple of techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction will be presented, as well as different libraries which can be used for these purposes.

## Knowledge requirements

* Basics of Machine learning and its classification models 
* Python programming language 
* Basics of [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library
* Basics of [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) library
* Basics of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library
* Basics of [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) library

## What we will use
* Python3
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/try)
* Python library: numpy
* Python library: pandas
* Python library: matplotlib
* Python library: scikit-learn
* Python library: nltk
* Python library: string

## How to install libraries
### Windows
It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (for Python3) to avoid manual install of required libraries.
### Linux
You can also use Anaconda, though you should generally referer to your distribution's recommended way of installing libraries.
